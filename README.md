# AMC-Tool
###### AMC-Tool meaning Ascii Movie Conversion Tool

This is a small project to finish my first year in my apprenticeship in computer science. <br>
I chose to use the OpenCV Library together with C++ to realize my Idea.<br>
The Tool should be able to convert a regular .mp4 to a "ascified" .mp4.<br>
