# ASCII-movie-converter

development branch <br>
Not Optimal: 
- Currently per frame linear increase in time needed to convert movie
- No sound

Ideas for optimizing:
- Using Threads to increase speed
- FFMPEG for sound


NOTE: openh264 library must be in directory with .exe for the program to work. Needed file Version 1.8.0 x64 [Download Here](https://github.com/cisco/openh264/releases)
