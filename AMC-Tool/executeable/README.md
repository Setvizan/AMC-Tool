~ AMC-Tool ~ <br>
extract the .zip file.<br>
Inside there are multiple files, such as: <br>
- AMC-Tool.exe
- openh264-1.8.0-win64.dll
- various OpenCV binary files for x64.

the files are required since i wasn't able to compile the opencv binary files into the AMC-Tool.exe <br>

Don't forget this is a CLI application!

Just add AMC-Tool to path and everything should work fine, if not try to Compile this program by yourself...
