~ AMC-Tool ~
extract the .zip file.<br>
Inside there are 3 files: <br>
- AMC-Tool.exe
- opencv_world452.dll
- openh264-1.8.0-win64.dll

the two dll are required for this application to work, i was unable to include them into the static build of the executable.<br>

Don't forget this is a CLI application!

Just add AMC-Tool to path and everything should work fine, if not try to Compile this program by yourself...
